I also have indepth experience in the Agile way of writing software and scrum based development groups. I was able to give clear, detailed, and concise updates on my efforts as a fellow developer. I also like to study languages and learn them such as Haskell or Rust. I believe that exposure to many different paradigms and programming styles can lead to more in depth knowledge of problems facing software development in the real and ever changing world.\r\n\r\n## Stuff I am interested in\r\n * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\r\n * Fault-tolerant web services and applications\r\n * MVC architecture and variants of MVC\r\n * Self-healing (can diagnose an issue in operation and attempt to fix it) online software platforms and applications\r\n * Robust data analytics and reporting\r\n\r\n## Programming Languages (in order of expertise)\r\n* C#   \r\n* Java\r\n* VB.net\r\n* JavaScript\r\n\r\n## Progrmming Lanaguages that I am still learning and those that I am interested in learning\r\n* [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)\r\n* [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)\r\n* [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/)\r\n* [Go](https://golang.org/)\r\n* [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)\r\n\r\n## Projects on GitHub\r\n* [Arke](https://github.com/carharttjimmy/Arke)\r\n* [FolderGenUtility](https://foldergenutility.jamesloyd.com)\r\n* [dotfiles mainly for xmonad](https://github.com/carharttjimmy/dotfiles-Balrog)\r\n\r\n## GitHub Gists (small program scripts)\r\n* [Money Counter](https://gist.github.com/carharttjimmy/fb33620426e9e5a6a989)\r\n  * written in C#\r\n* [Modular Equivalence](https://gist.github.com/carharttjimmy/ae34b02ad44a0dd8ddad)\r\n  * written in C#\r\n  * Uses the modern algebra definition. And, was just fun to make.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
