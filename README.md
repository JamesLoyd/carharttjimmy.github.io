=======================

## A little about me
I am a math major completing my senior year at UNCC.
And, I like to program. I also have indepth experience in the Agile way of writing software and scrum based development groups. I was able to give clear, detailed, and concise updates on my efforts as a fellow developer. I also like to study languages and learn them such as Haskell or Rust. I believe that exposure to many different paradigms and programming styles can lead to more in depth knowledge of problems facing software development in the real and ever changing world.

## Stuff I am interested in
 * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
 * Fault-tolerant web services and applications
 * MVC architecture and variants of MVC
 * Self-healing (can diagnose an issue in operation and attempt to fix it) online software platforms and applications
 * Robust data analytics and reporting

## Programming Languages (in order of expertise)
* C#   
* Java
* VB.net
* JavaScript

## Progrmming Lanaguages that I am still learning and those that I am interested in learning
* [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
* [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)
* [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Go](https://golang.org/)
* [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)

## Projects on GitHub
* [FolderGenUtility](https://foldergenutility.jamesloyd.com)
  * currently not-on-active development as I focus on school.  
* [dotfiles mainly for xmonad](https://github.com/carharttjimmy/dotfiles-Balrog)

## GitHub Gists (small program scripts)
* [Money Counter](https://gist.github.com/carharttjimmy/fb33620426e9e5a6a989)
  * written in C#
* [Modular Equivalence](https://gist.github.com/carharttjimmy/ae34b02ad44a0dd8ddad)
  * written in C#
  * Uses the modern algebra definition. And, was just fun to make.
